What would be primary unit of analysis that is “what will be the subject of the study?”. Against This subject of study different variables, factors or data points will be collected during the course of research. Second, the architecture of such variables, their dimensions and their relationship to the subject and relationship between them. Third, how this collection of data will be used to prove or disapprove researcher’s point. That is to say how the data grouped with respect to researcher’s subject will determine whether researcher’s point is proved or not.One of the easiest ways of doing this ( Data Analysis Plan Procedure Pre Research ) is to design a spreadsheet popularly known as the master-chart. Usually this master-chart consists of the subject as the first column and its variables as subsequent columns. Last set of the columns consist of different relationships. It is important to note here that from a statistical point of view these relationships define the quantum or size of the sample space required to be studied. Finally, It is also necessary to keep in mind that during the course of research some variables might not be important and some additional variables might be incorporated."

				{
					"@type":"Answer",
					"text":"There are many forms of thesis and each kind requires a different type of justification. The nature of justification depends largely on the objective and the birds eye view answer to the question “Why this research?”. If the topic of your thesis is not original the context of the above answer, a quick internet search would throw relevant articles. However, corollary to this the results would contain articles close to your research but not exactly similar. Additionally, Proposal Justification for the thesis should also involve review of published research across other known and respected databases relevant to your domain. A systematic process is followed while undertaking secondary data analysis. This is done in order to further reinforce relevance to your thesis. The process involves aspects like statistical similarities and differences in both data collection and research design. Furthermore, a standardized approach towards data and statistical interpretation of past researches is necessary. With such a process approach justification becomes more resilient and irrefutable."

	<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="TeX Gyre Schola">Exploratory
	and preliminary data analysis is a critical first step in analysing
	data from a research. The main reasons to do this include: (1)
	detection of mistakes (2) checking of assumptions (3) preliminary
	selection of appropriate methods for further analysis (4)
	determining relationships among the explanatory variables (5)
	assessing the direction and rough size of relationships between
	explanatory and outcome variables.</font></p>
	<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="TeX Gyre Schola">Data
	from a research is generally collated into a rectangular array
	(e.g., spreadsheet or database), most commonly with one row per
	research subject and one column for each subject identifier, outcome
	variable, and explanatory variable. Each column contains the numeric
	values for a particular quantitative variable or the levels for a
	categorical variable. Data Analysis Methods Exploratory Preliminary
	have been devised as an aid for looking at data in interesting ways
	without getting overwhelmed. Therefore, Most of these methods work
	in part by hiding certain aspects of the data while making other
	aspects more clear, this is important while writing.</font></p>
	<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="TeX Gyre Schola">Exploratory
	data analysis is generally cross-classified in two ways. First, each
	method is either non-graphical or graphical. And second, each method
	is either univariate or ultivariate (usually just bivariate).
	Non-graphical methods generally involve calculation of summary
	statistics, while graphical methods obviously summarize the data in
	a diagrammatic or pictorial way. Univariate methods look at one
	variable (data column) at a time, while multivariate methods look at
	two or more variables at a time to explore relationships. Usually
	multivariate analysis will be bivariate (looking at exactly two
	variables), but occasionally it will involve three or more
	variables. Beyond the four categories created by the above
	cross-classification, each of the categories of EDA have further
	divisions based on the role (outcome or explanatory) and type
	(categorical or quantitative) of the variable(s) being examined
	while writing.</font></p>

	draw inferences from the same, respectively. Descriptive Statistics
	are used to describe the basic features of the data in a study. They
	provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures. Together
	with simple graphics analysis, they form the basis of virtually
	every quantitative analysis of data. With descriptive statistics you
	are simply describing what is, what the data shows. Inferential
	Statistics investigate questions, models and hypotheses. In many
	cases, the conclusions from inferential statistics extend beyond the
	immediate data alone. For instance, we use inferential statistics to
	try to infer from the sample data what the population thinks. Or, we
	use inferential statistics to make judgements of the probability
	that an observed difference between groups is a dependable one or
	one that might have happened by chance in this study. Thus, we use
	inferential statistics to make inferences from our data to more
	general conditions in writing.</font></p>
	<p align="justify" style="line-height: 150%"><font face="TeX Gyre Schola">Descriptive
	Statistics are used to present quantitative descriptions in a
	manageable form. Each descriptive statistic reduces lots of data
	into a simpler summary. Every time a large set of observations is
	described with a single indicator there is a risk of distorting the
	original data or losing important detail. Given this limitation,
	descriptive statistics provide a powerful summary that may enable
	comparisons across units of analysis. Descriptive statistics provide
	information about our immediate group of data. Descriptive
	statistics are applied to populations, and the properties of
	populations, like the mean or standard deviation, are called
	parameters as they represent the whole population (i.e., everybody
	the researcher is interested in). Often, however, a researcher does
	not have access to the whole population he/she is interested in
	investigating, but only a limited number (sample) of data instead
	during writing. Properties of samples, such as the mean or standard
	deviation, are not called parameters, but statistics. Inferential
	statistics are techniques that allow us to use these samples to make
	generalizations about the populations from which the samples were
	drawn. It is, therefore, important that the sample accurately
	represents the population. Inferential statistics arise out of the
	fact that sampling naturally incurs sampling error and thus a sample
	is not expected to perfectly represent the population. The methods
	of inferential statistics are (1) the estimation of parameter(s) and
	(2) testing of statistical hypotheses.</font></p>

	Against This subject of study different variables, factors or data

	relationship to the subject and relationship between them. Third,
	how this collection of data will be used to prove or disapprove

	the first column and its variables as subsequent columns. Last set
	of the columns consist of different relationships. It is important
	to note here that from a statistical point of view these
	relationships define the quantum or size of the sample space
	required to be studied. Finally, It is also necessary to keep in
